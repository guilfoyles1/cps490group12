# Messenger App (CPS 490 Group 12)

## Project Overview
This project is a Messenger Application developed as part of Capstone 1. It provides users with the ability to send and receive messages in real-time. The application uses Node.js, Express, Socket.io, and MongoDB to facilitate seamless communication. It supports both private and group messaging with a user-friendly interface.

## Features
- Real-time messaging between users
- Group chat functionality
- User authentication and session management
- Password hashing for security
- Interactive front-end views
- RESTful API for communication between the front-end and back-end

## Authors
- Abby Foppe
- Shay Guilfoyle
- Paras Rajan
- Zach Spears

## Prerequisites
- Node.js v14 or higher
- npm v6 or higher
- MongoDB running locally or an accessible MongoDB URI

## Installation and Setup

1. **Clone the repository**
  ```sh
  git clone https://github.com/guilfoyles1/cps490group12
  cd cps490group12
  ```
2. **Install dependencies**
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

3. **Create Environment Variables**
   - Create a `.env` file in the `src` directory with the necessary environment variables:
     ```
     PORT=3000
     MONGODB_URI=<your-mongodb-uri>
     SESSION_SECRET=<your-session-secret>
     ```
     Note: The `.env` file is ignored by Git and needs to be manually created.

4. **Run the Application**
   - To start the application in development mode, first navigate to the `src` directory and then run:
     ```sh
     cd src
     nodemon index.js
     ```

## Sprint 2 Project Report

This section provides the user guide, program flow, and user interface design details for Sprint 2. The report aims to document the current status and design considerations of the Messenger App.

### Functional Requirements
- **Account Creation**: Users must be able to register with an email and password to create an account.
- **Login and Authentication**: Users can securely log in to access the chat application.
- **Real-Time Messaging**: Users can send and receive messages in real time, either one-on-one or in groups.
- **Group Chats**: Users can create or join group chats to communicate with multiple participants simultaneously.
- **User Settings**: Users should be able to update their personal information, such as username and password.

### Program Flow
1. **Account Registration**: Users begin by creating an account through the registration page, which validates their information and stores it securely in the database.
2. **User Login**: After registration, users log in using their email and password. Successful authentication allows them to proceed to the chat interface.
3. **Homepage**: Once logged in, users are taken to the homepage, where they can access their account settings or chats.
4. **Chats**: Users can start a new chat or continue existing conversations, whether one-on-one or in group settings.
5. **Account Settings**: Users can navigate to their settings to update personal information and manage their credentials.
6. **Logout**: Users can securely log out of their accounts from any page.

### User Interface Design
The design of the Messenger App prioritizes usability and accessibility:

- **Minimalist Layout**: The interface uses a clean, minimalist layout that highlights the main features, minimizing distractions.
- **Color Palette**: The application uses a consistent color palette that provides an inviting and professional appearance.
- **Navigation**: A simple navigation bar is planned for future iterations to improve ease of use.
- **Responsive Design**: The UI has been designed to adapt to various screen sizes, providing an optimized experience across desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.

The current state of the homepage, as seen in the screenshot, provides an initial glimpse into the layout and core actions available to users. Future improvements aim to add more interactivity and enhance the visual appeal.
